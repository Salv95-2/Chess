# This is an Android Application that I have been developing on my spare time. It is work in progess, but it is currently in the state where the Black Pieces AI can detect if a future move will result in the piece being eliminated. The code for the behavior of all pieces is complete. The Strategy pattern is used to take advantage of polymorphism and to organize the ineraction between the pieces. At the moment, the goal is to have the AI think one step ahead(Very close to accomplishing this). Eventually, the app will be improved by making it process more steps ahead.
